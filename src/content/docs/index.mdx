My name is TheBlockiest, and I designed this chart guide to teach people the fundamentals of not only charting in EX-XDRiVER, but also chart design as a whole!

When I first got into EX-XDRiVER, one of the first things that stuck out to me about the game was the quality of its charts. All charts in the game had a layer of intent, clarity, and quality, *especially* for a free rhythm game. When I started creating custom charts for the game, I tried to emulate many of the qualities I saw in base-game XDRV content.

I'd say I found a good bit of success doing that, especially now that I've been on the official XDRV chart team for over a year 🎉

While I picked up on XDRV charting quickly, I'm still aware of how inaccessible the medium can be. XDRV charting can seem very complex from the outside. Once you get familiar with the game, however, you'll (hopefully) find the medium to be rewarding, sporting a unique array of creative strengths and limitations.

For those who want to make stuff unbounded by "standardization," this guide should give you the technical skills to make whatever you want in XDRV! For those more curious about what makes XDRV charting *click*, I've added plenty of articles discussing the intricacies of charting for the game. I hope you can learn something from it!
